My version of [The Odin Project's landing page HTML and CSS project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

Deviations from intial design:
1. I attempt to use responsive design which involved:
- Ignoring the text-sizing on the inital design and instead viewing the texts as relative to eachother and the webpage itself
- All boxes being relative to eachother
2. Some colours were not specified so I used colours similar

Improvements:
- Better colour accuracy to original design
- Cleaner CSS styling. I could have reused containers and built on them. But all for knowing next time!
